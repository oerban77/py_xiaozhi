## Tool List

### 1. Online Music Tool

#### music_player.search_and_play - Search and Play Online Music

Calls the online music API based on song title, artist, or keywords to download and play the target song. If currently playing, it will stop first before playing the new song.

**Parameters:**

- `song_name` (required): The song title, artist, or keywords to search for

**Use Cases:**

- Play a specific song
- Search for all or latest songs by an artist
- Let the AI recommend or play popular songs

### 2. Playback Control Tools

#### music_player.pause - Pause Playback

Pauses the current song and retains the current position. Suitable for manual pause or when the user actively requests pausing.

**Parameters:**
None

**Use Cases:**

- Pause current playback
- Coordinate with TTS playback for early manual pause
- Scenarios requiring temporary mute

#### music_player.resume - Resume Playback

Continues playback from the paused position. Only triggers after a manual pause to avoid conflict with automatic TTS pause.

**Parameters:**
None

**Use Cases:**

- User says "resume playback" or "continue playing"
- Manual resume required after automatic TTS pause
- Confirming that music has been manually paused

#### music_player.stop - Stop Playback

Ends the current song and resets the playback progress. This is a complete stop operation.

**Parameters:**
None

**Use Cases:**

- User explicitly requests "stop/close the music"
- Need to clear playback state when switching sessions or scenes
- Avoid background continuing playback

#### music_player.seek - Seek Playback Position

Skips to a specified second position in the song. Internally restarts the decoder to ensure playback synchronization.

**Parameters:**

- `position` (required): The seek position (in seconds, integer >= 0)

**Use Cases:**

- Fast forward to a specific time point
- Go back to the beginning or chorus of the song
- Navigate to a specific segment as requested by the user

### 3. Lyrics Tool

#### music_player.get_lyrics - Get Current Song Lyrics

Returns a list of lyrics text with timestamps. If no lyrics are available, a notification message is returned.

**Parameters:**
None

**Use Cases:**

- User wants to view or sing along with lyrics
- Display the currently playing line
- Check if lyrics are available

> Note: The player internally maintains playback progress, pause source, and other states, but MCP currently only exposes control tools and lyrics queries.

### 4. Local Music Tool

#### music_player.get_local_playlist - Get Local Cached Playlist

Scans the local cache directory and returns a list of downloaded songs. Each item in the result is in the format "Song Title - Artist" and can be passed back to `music_player.search_and_play` for playback.

**Parameters:**

- `force_refresh` (optional): Whether to force re-scan the cache directory, default false

**Use Cases:**

- View local cache contents
- Quickly initiate playback based on cached songs
- Debug or verify cache status

### 5. Direct URL Playback Tool

#### music_player.play_url - Play a Direct Audio URL

Plays a direct audio URL (http/https), such as an MP3 link. The audio is decoded with FFmpeg, so any direct audio file link works.

**Parameters:**

- `url` (required): The direct audio URL, e.g. `https://cdn.equran.id/audio-full/Misyari-Rasyid-Al-Afasi/055.mp3`
- `title` (optional): A display name for the song; if empty, the URL is used

**Use Cases:**

- User provides a direct audio link to play
- Play audio from a specific URL (e.g. a Quran recitation MP3, a podcast, etc.)

## Usage Examples

### Online Music Playback Examples

```python
# Search and play a song
result = await mcp_server.call_tool("music_player.search_and_play", {
    "song_name": "Jay Chou Blue and White Porcelain"
})

# Pause and resume
await mcp_server.call_tool("music_player.pause", {})
await mcp_server.call_tool("music_player.resume", {})

# Stop playback
await mcp_server.call_tool("music_player.stop", {})

# Seek to a specific position (in seconds)
await mcp_server.call_tool("music_player.seek", {
    "position": 90
})
```

### Local Music Management Examples

```python
# Get local music list
playlist = await mcp_server.call_tool("music_player.get_local_playlist", {
    "force_refresh": True
})

# Select a song from the local playlist and play again
if playlist.get("playlist"):
    first_song = playlist["playlist"][0].split(" - ")[0]
    await mcp_server.call_tool("music_player.search_and_play", {
        "song_name": first_song
    })
```

### Lyrics Query Example

```python
lyrics = await mcp_server.call_tool("music_player.get_lyrics", {})
```

> Status and progress are available via the MCP tool `music_player.get_status`; lyric pushes can still use EventBus events.

## Technical Architecture

### Music Player Core

- **Container-injected session**: `MusicPlayer` is created by the service container / wiring layer and passed into `register_music_tools(add_tool, player)` (closure). There is **no** `get_music_player_instance` global singleton.
- **Composition**: `MusicPlayer` owns `PlaybackEngine` (decode queue / transport controls) and `MusicEventBridge` (EventBus). Registration lives in `music/register.py`.
- **FFmpeg + AudioCodec**: `MusicDecoder` (FFmpeg) feeds the shared `AudioCodec` (injected via `AUDIO_CODEC_CHANGED`).
- **Async queue**: Decoded PCM goes through `asyncio.Queue` into the playback loop.
- **Event-driven control**: Subscribes to `MUSIC_PAUSE_REQUEST` / `MUSIC_RESUME_REQUEST` (e.g. TTS `source=tts`) and emits state/lyric events.

### Audio Processing

- **Decoding**: On-demand FFmpeg via `MusicDecoder` (MP3/M4A/FLAC/WAV/OGG, etc.).
- **Timeline**: Duration from `ffprobe` and/or lyrics; seek/resume rebuilds the decoder.
- **PCM**: float32, downmixed to mono before `AudioCodec`.
- **Lyrics**: Driven by the main playback loop (`_tick_lyrics`), not a long-lived separate task.

### Online Service Integration

- **TuneFree API**: Uniformly accesses online search, playback links, lyrics, and song information via `https://music-dl.sayqz.com/api/`.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: `DEFAULT_SOURCE` can be configured for platforms like kuwo, netease, etc. `SEARCH_LIMIT` controls the number of search results.
- **High Bitrate Playback**: Default `DEFAULT_BR=320k`, can also switch to flac or other higher quality options.
- **Network Robustness**: Requests are wrapped with `asyncio.to_thread` + `requests`, with built-in timeout and error logging.

### Local Music Management

- **Cache Directory**: Automatically creates cache and temporary directories under `get_user_cache_dir()/music`.
- **Periodic Scanning**: Refreshes the cache index at least every 5 minutes; can force a scan via `force_refresh` when needed.
- **Metadata Extraction**: If Mutagen is installed, automatically reads title, artist, album, and duration.
- **Playback Reuse**: Downloaded songs in the cache are served directly from local files for replay, reducing network requests.
